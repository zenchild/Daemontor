This modules purpose is to daemonize processes so they can be run in the background like a
standard UNIX daemon.  When Daemontor::daemonize is called the parent process fork()s a
new child process and calls Process.detach so we don't have to wait for the child process
to exit.  The parent process then exits and the child process goes happily on.  Since we are
calling Process.detach we do not need to do a double-fork

Thanks to the PickAxe book for good process handling information as well as hints from
Travis Whitton's Daemonize module: http://grub.ath.cx/daemonize/
